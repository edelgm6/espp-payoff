                The leftmost section of the chart represents stock prices that <strong>are low enough
                to hit the 1000 shares purchase limit</strong>, i.e., when you cannot invest the entire
                $12,500. Given the 15% purchase discount, this limit kicks in at $12.50 / .85, or $14.70.
                At this point, each dollar change in the stock price drives a $150 change in the payoff.
                E.g., at $5, you purchase 1000 shares for $4.25 (i.e., the 85% discount), locking in a
                gain of $750 (i.e., 5 x $150).

            <p>The simplest part of the payoff chart to understand is the flat part in the middle. This represents the stock prices where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The stock price at the end of the offering period is less than the stock price at the beginning of the offering period</li>
                <li>And the stock price is still high enough that you can invest the entire $12,500 (i.e., you don't hit the 1000 share limit)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this case, you will invest $12,500 at an 85% discount to the current stock price, yielding a ~17% return, or ~$2205 gain.</p>

                The rightmost section of the chart represents stock prices where <strong>the
                price at the end of the period is greater than the price at the beginning of the period.</strong>
                To understand why, consider our original example:
            </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Stock price is $28 at the beginning of the purchase period</li>
                  <li>Stock price is $34 at the end of the purchase period</li>
                  <li>You buy $12,500 worth of stock at a 15% discount <strong>to the $28
                    starting price</strong> since it is lower than the ending price</li>
                  <li>You get a return of (($34 - .85 * $28) / .85 * $28) * $12,500, or $5357</li>
                </ul>
