        <h1>What is your ESPP worth?</h1>
        <p>Many companies offer an Employee Stock Purchase plan — the option to buy shares in the company at at a 15% discount
          to the price at the beginning or the end of the purchase period.</p>
        <p>This seems like a good deal — but <b>how good of a deal is it?</b> Put another way, if we went to Goldman Sachs
          and told them that we wanted them to sell us a security that behaved like an ESPP, how much would it cost?
          That's what we're going to find out.</p>

          <p>This chart shows the payoff from your ESPP investment assuming you invest the full $12,500. Things to note:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Any stock price between the current price and ~$14.70 will give a flat payoff of ~$2,200</li>
            <li>Below ~$14.70, your payoff decreases by $150 for every dollar decrease in the stock price</li>
            <li>Any stock price above the current stock price has a payoff greater than $2,300</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This shows the <strong>replicating portfolio</strong> — i.e., the collection of stocks and options that,
            considered together, creates the same payoff chart seen above.

      <h2>Understanding the payoff chart</h2>

      <div class="col-md-12">
      <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-5">
        <p>An Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) typically has the following features:
        <ul>
          <li>Purchase limit: Purchase your company's stock up to the lower of —</li>
            <ul>
              <li>$12,500</li>
              <li>1000 shares</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Purchase price: Purchase your company's stock at price of the lower of:
          <ul>
            <li>85% of the price at the <strong>beginning</strong> of the period</li>
            <li>85% of the price at the <strong>end</strong> of the period</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        That system creates a payoff chart like what we have to the right — from, $0, it <strong>increases by $150 per dollar in share
        price</strong>, then flattens out until it hits the <strong>price at the beginning of the offering period</strong>
        and then increases <strong>proportionately to the increase in stock price</strong> relative to the current price.

        If that's confusing don't worry — we'll go through it step by step.
